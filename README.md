# Eclipse - An Open Source Revolt Client

Eclipse is an unofficial client for the [Revolt]() platform.

**Purpose:**

The main goal of this project is to make the transition from my current Discord server to Revolt as smooth and simple as possible.

**Project Status:**

Since Revolt is still a relatively new platform, building a full-featured client will take time. This project is in its early stages, and I am committed to helping it grow and reach an acceptable level of quality.

**User Interface:**

Eclipse’s interface is heavily inspired by the official Revolt mobile client. It aims to be clean, beautiful, and user-friendly.

**Current Tasks:**

| Feature               | Status |
| :-------------------- | :----- |
| Login                 | ☐     |
| Signup                | ☐      |
| Home Page             | ☐      |
| Direct Messages (DMs) | ☐      |
| Servers               | ☐      |

Once these basic features are completed, the focus will shift to other parts of the application.

**Notes from Moon :3**

As a beginner developer, my programming experience is still basic. This project is a learning journey for me. Bugs, logical errors, and potential inefficiencies in the code are to be expected. However, I’m dedicated to learning, optimizing Eclipse for different devices, and revisiting the code for future improvements.

I appreciate any feedback and constructive criticism. I believe making mistakes is an important part of the learning process.
